# 📊 BMW Sales Data Analysis (2010–2024)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization of BMW sales data from 2010 to 2024.  
The analysis aims to uncover sales trends, pricing patterns, regional performance, and relationships between vehicle specifications and sales volume using Python.

This project is created as a portfolio to demonstrate practical data analysis and visualization skills.

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains historical BMW sales records with the following attributes:

- **Model** – BMW vehicle model  
- **Year** – Production or sales year  
- **Region** – Sales region  
- **Color** – Vehicle color  
- **Fuel_Type** – Type of fuel used  
- **Transmission** – Transmission type  
- **Engine_Size_L** – Engine size in liters  
- **Mileage_KM** – Vehicle mileage in kilometers  
- **Price_USD** – Vehicle price in USD  
- **Sales_Volume** – Number of units sold  
- **Sales_Classification** – Sales performance category
