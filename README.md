📊 BMW Sales Data Analysis (2010–2024)
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization of BMW sales data from 2010 to 2024.
The objective is to uncover sales trends, pricing patterns, regional performance, and relationships between vehicle specifications and sales volume using Python.

The analysis is designed as a portfolio-ready project demonstrating skills in:

Data cleaning

Exploratory data analysis

Visualization

Business insight generation

📂 Dataset Information

The dataset contains historical BMW sales records with the following columns:

Column Name	Description

📈 Key Insights

Certain BMW models consistently dominate total sales volume.

Higher engine sizes are strongly correlated with higher prices.

Mileage has a negative relationship with vehicle price.

Sales volume trends vary significantly across regions.

Recent years show a shift toward more efficient engine sizes.
